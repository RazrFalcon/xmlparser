*xmlparser* is a low-level, pull-based, zero-allocation
[XML 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/) parser.

### Example

```rust
for token in xmlparser::Tokenizer::from("<tagname name='value'/>") {
    println!("{:?}", token);
}
```

### Why a new library?

This library is basically a low-level XML tokenizer that preserves the positions of the tokens
and is not intended to be used directly.
If you are looking for a higher level solution, check out
[roxmltree](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/roxmltree).

### Benefits

- All tokens contain `StrSpan` structs which represent the position of the substring
  in the original document.
- Good error processing. All error types contain the position (line:column) where it occurred.
- No heap allocations.
- No dependencies.
- Tiny. ~1400 LOC and ~30KiB in the release build according to `cargo-bloat`.
- Supports `no_std` builds. To use without the standard library, disable the default features.

### Limitations

- Currently, only ENTITY objects are parsed from the DOCTYPE. All others are ignored.
- No tree structure validation. So an XML like `<root><child></root></child>`
  or a string without root element
  will be parsed without errors. You should check for this manually.
  On the other hand `<a/><a/>` will lead to an error.
- Duplicated attributes is not an error. So XML like `<item a="v1" a="v2"/>`
  will be parsed without errors. You should check for this manually.
- UTF-8 only.

### Safety

- The library must not panic. Any panic is considered a critical bug
  and should be reported.
- The library forbids unsafe code.
